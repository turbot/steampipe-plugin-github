# Table: github_repository_vulnerability_alert - Query GitHub Repository Vulnerability Alerts using SQL

GitHub Repository Vulnerability Alerts is a feature within GitHub that allows users to monitor and respond to security vulnerabilities in their repositories. It provides a centralized way to set up and manage alerts for various repositories, including package names, affected ranges, and alert statuses. GitHub Repository Vulnerability Alerts helps users stay informed about the security status of their repositories and take appropriate actions when potential vulnerabilities are detected.

## Table Usage Guide

The `github_repository_vulnerability_alert` table provides insights into repository vulnerability alerts within GitHub. As a security analyst, explore alert-specific details through this table, including alert status, affected package name, and affected range. Utilize it to uncover information about potential vulnerabilities, such as those with high severity, the affected versions of packages, and the verification of fixed versions.

**Important Notes**
- You must specify the `repository_full_name` (repository including org/user prefix) column in the `where` or `join` clause to query the table.

## Examples

### List vulnerability alerts
This query helps to analyze the security vulnerabilities of a particular Github repository. It provides insights into the severity and description of each vulnerability, aiding in prioritizing and addressing security concerns effectively.

```sql+postgres
select
  number,
  created_at,
  state,
  security_advisory -> 'cvss' -> 'score' as cvss_score,
  security_advisory ->> 'description' as description,
  severity,
  vulnerable_manifest_filename,
  vulnerable_manifest_path
from
  github_repository_vulnerability_alert
where
  repository_full_name = 'turbot/steampipe';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  number,
  created_at,
  state,
  json_extract(json_extract(security_advisory, '$.cvss'), '$.score') as cvss_score,
  json_extract(security_advisory, '$.description') as description,
  severity,
  vulnerable_manifest_filename,
  vulnerable_manifest_path
from
  github_repository_vulnerability_alert
where
  repository_full_name = 'turbot/steampipe';
```

### List open vulnerability alerts
The query aids in identifying active vulnerability alerts within a specific GitHub repository. This is useful for maintaining the security of the repository by addressing potential threats promptly.

```sql+postgres
select
  number,
  created_at,
  state,
  security_advisory -> 'cvss' -> 'score' as cvss_score,
  security_advisory ->> 'description' as description,
  severity,
  vulnerable_manifest_filename,
  vulnerable_manifest_path
from
  github_repository_vulnerability_alert
where
  repository_full_name = 'turbot/steampipe'
  and state = 'OPEN';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  number,
  created_at,
  state,
  json_extract(security_advisory, '$.cvss.score') as cvss_score,
  json_extract(security_advisory, '$.description') as description,
  severity,
  vulnerable_manifest_filename,
  vulnerable_manifest_path
from
  github_repository_vulnerability_alert
where
  repository_full_name = 'turbot/steampipe'
  and state = 'OPEN';
```

### List open critical vulnerability alerts
Identify critical security vulnerabilities in a specific GitHub repository that are currently open. This can help prioritize security efforts and address the most severe issues first.

```sql+postgres
select
  number,
  created_at,
  state,
  security_advisory -> 'cvss' -> 'score' as cvss_score,
  security_advisory ->> 'description' as description,
  severity,
  vulnerable_manifest_filename,
  vulnerable_manifest_path
from
  github_repository_vulnerability_alert
where
  repository_full_name = 'turbot/steampipe'
  and state = 'OPEN'
  and severity = 'CRITICAL';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  number,
  created_at,
  state,
  json_extract(json_extract(security_advisory, '$.cvss'), '$.score') as cvss_score,
  json_extract(security_advisory, '$.description') as description,
  severity,
  vulnerable_manifest_filename,
  vulnerable_manifest_path
from
  github_repository_vulnerability_alert
where
  repository_full_name = 'turbot/steampipe'
  and state = 'OPEN'
  and severity = 'CRITICAL';
```
