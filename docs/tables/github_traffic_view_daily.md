# Table: github_traffic_view_daily - Query GitHub Traffic Views using SQL

GitHub Traffic Views is a feature within GitHub that allows you to monitor and respond to traffic patterns across your repositories. It provides a centralized way to set up and monitor views for various GitHub repositories, including the number of visitors, unique visitors, and the number of views per day. GitHub Traffic Views helps you stay informed about the health and performance of your GitHub repositories and take appropriate actions when predefined conditions are met.

## Table Usage Guide

The `github_traffic_view_daily` table provides insights into daily repository views within GitHub. As a repository owner, explore view-specific details through this table, including the number of views, unique visitors, and the timestamp of the views. Utilize it to uncover information about views, such as those with high traffic, the peak times for views, and the verification of view patterns.

**Important Notes**
- You must specify the `repository_full_name` column in `where` or `join` clause to query the table.
