# Table: github_rate_limit - Query GitHub Rate Limits using SQL

GitHub Rate Limits are a part of the GitHub API that sets the maximum number of requests that a user can make within an hour. These limits are designed to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the GitHub API. They apply to authenticated and unauthenticated users, and vary depending on the type of authentication used.

## Table Usage Guide

The `github_rate_limit` table provides insights into the rate limits set by GitHub for API usage. As a developer or system administrator, you can use this table to monitor your application's API usage, ensuring it stays within the prescribed limits to avoid service disruption. This table is also useful for planning and optimizing the distribution of API requests to maximize efficiency and avoid hitting the rate limit.

## Examples
