# Table: github_my_gist

Github Gist is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others.  The `github_my_gist` table will list only gists that **you own**.  

To query **ANY** gist that you have access to (including any public gists), use the `github_gist` table.

## Examples

### List your gists

```sql
select
  *
from
  github_my_gist;
```


### List your public gists

```sql
select
  *
from
  github_my_gist
where
  public;
```
