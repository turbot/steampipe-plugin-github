# Table: github_my_star - Query GitHub My Stars using SQL

GitHub Stars is a feature within GitHub that allows users to bookmark repositories for later reference. Users can star repositories to keep track of projects they find interesting, even if they do not directly contribute to them. This feature serves as a way to show appreciation for the repository maintainers' work and also to keep track of repositories for later use.

## Table Usage Guide

The `github_my_star` table provides insights into the repositories starred by the authenticated GitHub user. As a developer or project manager, explore details through this table, including repository names, owners, and star creation dates. Utilize it to analyze user preferences, discover potential areas of interest, and manage your starred repositories effectively.
