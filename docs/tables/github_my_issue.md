# Table: github_my_issue - Query GitHub Issues using SQL

GitHub Issues is a feature in GitHub that provides a platform to track bugs, enhancements, or other requests. It allows users to collaborate on tasks, discuss project details, and manage project timelines. Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, improvements, and bugs for your projects.

## Table Usage Guide

The `github_my_issue` table provides insights into personal issues within GitHub. As a project manager or developer, explore issue-specific details through this table, including the issue title, state, assignee, and associated metadata. Utilize it to manage and track tasks, improvements, and bugs for your projects.

**Important Notes**
- To view **all the issues belonging to a repository**, use the `github_issue` table.

  author_login
from
  github_my_issue
where
  state = 'OPEN';

where
  state = 'OPEN'
order by
  created_at
limit 10;
