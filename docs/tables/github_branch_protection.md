# Table: github_branch_protection

Branch protection is a set of rules protecting the branch from inappropriate changes.

The `github_branch_protection` table can be used to query information about any branch, and **you must specify which repository** in the where or join clause using the `repository_full_name` column.

GitHub users with admin permissions to a repository can manage branch protection rules.

## Examples

### List branches and their protection for a repository

```sql
select
  *
from
  github_branch_protection
where
  repository_full_name = 'turbot/steampipe';
```

### Get branch protection for a specific repo

```sql
select
  *
from
  github_branch_protection
where
  repository_full_name = 'turbot/steampipe'
  and name = 'main';
```
